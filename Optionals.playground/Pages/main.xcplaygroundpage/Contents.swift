//this is of type String






/*: question2

var petName: String?



// this is of type String?


/*: question3

 */

//currently it is nil





/*: question4
 ### 4. Give `petName` a value! Assign to it any string. What is its type now?
 */
petName = "Herbert"






/*: question5
 ### 5. Print out `petName` using Swift's `print()` function. What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
print(petName)







/*: question6
 ### 6. Write an if statement that only prints `petName`'s value if it is not `nil`. If `petName` is `nil`, print, "There is no pet name." What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
if petName != nil {
    print("My pet's name is\(petName)")
} else {
    print("no pet")
}






/*: question7
 ### 7. Use _optional binding_ to unwrap the value of `petName` and print it to the console without all the **Optional(...)** stuff around it.
 */
if let petName = petName {
    print("My friend's pet is \(petName)")
}







/*: question8
 ### 8. Write an if statement that will print out "The value of anotherPetName is nil" using the variable below
 */
var anotherPetName: String?


if anotherPetName == nil {
    print("The value of anotherPetName is nil")
}







/*: question9
 ### 9. Using optional binding, write an if statement that prints "anotherPetName has no value" if it is `nil`; otherwise, print the _unwrapped_ value of `anotherPetName`. What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
if let name = anotherPetName {
    print(name)
} else {
    print("anotherPetName is has no value")
}







/*: question10
 ### 10. Declare a _constant_ optional string (using the `let` keyword). Then try to assign a string value to it on the next line. Print out the constant. What happens?
 */
let myPetName: String?
myPetName = "Sparkles 🐩"
print(myPetName)









/*: question11
 ### 11. Declare another _constant_ optional string, and set it to `nil` immediately. Then, on the next line, assign a string value to it. What happens?
 */
let somePet: String? = nil
somePet = "kitten 🐈"
